# eng-software-teensy
eng-software team repo for Teensy code

Set your arduino sketchbook directory to the one you cloned from the repo and you should be good to go.

Make sure none of the libraries in the sketchbook are also in your global libraries directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\teensy\avr\libraries) as they will supersede the modified versions we're using.
